# Eaton M2 network card configuration tool

i did this project to help my father configure alot of machines without the hassle of going into the configuration menu of each machine and changing it.

To run the project run M2_config_manual_parameters with python.

It will open a GUI with configuration information you will need to fill and submit and let the software do its thing untill a popup will show.
